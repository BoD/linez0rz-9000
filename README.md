# linez0rz 9000

This is a \<falling tetromino Sovietic puzzle game> clone, written in Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose.

Supported platforms:

- Android
- Desktop (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- Browser (Wasm)

Keyboard, Gamepads, and touch controls are supported.

The twist:

## Your goal is to clear **9000** lines!

The game board is automatically saved so you can pause a game and come back to it later. This way, a particular game
is expected to last a long period of time, a few months or even years.

Good luck!
